			This code of conduct (CoC) is an evolving and open-source document.  Please feel free to suggest changes via GitHub Issues, Pull Requests, and/or the Slack.  Let's keep it brief.
			<ol>
				<li>
					<b>Be courteous and respectful.</b>  For more details on what it means to be courteous and respectful, refer to the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/code-of-conduct.html">Linux Code of Conduct</a>.  For examples of what it means to be <i>dis</i>courteous and <i>dis</i>respectful, refer to the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/07/linus-torvalds-defends-his-right-to-shame-linux-kernel-developers/">user-group correspondence about the proposed Linux Code of Conduct</a>.  Another excellent resource is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Manners-Excruciatingly-Correct-Behavior-Freshly/dp/0393058743">Miss Manners' Guide to Excruciatingly Correct Behavior</a>, which my mom made me read in high school.
				</li>
				<br>
				<li>
					<b>Don't ask stupid questions.</b>  A stupid question is one that does not respect the presenter.  For example, I once attended an academic presentation by the director of the NASA Mars Rover program, where someone asked (in earnest) why we don't use a roller-coaster with a big jump at the end instead of a rocket to get to space.  Because we are an academic reading group, it is important that our questions reflect our goals (namely, advancing our own education and research) and respect our presenters (by engaging with their presentation at a deep level).
				</li>
				<br>
				<li>
					<b>Try to follow the presentation format when you present.</b>  The presentation should assume an undergraduate-level familiarity with mathematics and computer science (we assume familiarity with real analysis, topology, abstract algebra, etc.) yet still formally define every concept (even rudimentary ones like <i>set</i>).  The reason we insist on definitions is because (1) your definition might be interesting (see for example the definition of <i>set</i> given in the <a href="https://youtu.be/3W0h3WzxgIE">MIT Programming from Categories Lecture 0</a>) and (2) forcing you to define everything and present your ideas in just 20m will make your presentation really good.
